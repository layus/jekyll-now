    <title>Reproducibility killed the frankenbuild</title>
    <link>https://blog.layus.be/posts/2021-06-25-frankenbuilds.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<article>
    <p>They have been around for far too long. It’s about time to tackle those pesky frankenbuilds. Coined in 2016 by Esfahani et al. the term describes “builds where outputs from different build jobs can combine in inconsistent ways due to cache re-use”.</p>
<p>Let’s start with an example scenario for the problem. Imagine a build systems that runs a benchmark of some program and then processes the results into a human friendly html summary. Both results get added to the cache, but the benchmark results get later evicted from the cache. On the next build, the cache miss forces a new execution from the cache, and uploads the new version to the now empty cache slot. All the cache entries contain a valid build output, but is left in an inconsistent state where the html summary corresponds to a benchmark that is not available anymore. When the builder downloads the cached html report, it ends up in an incorrect build state, where the report is not up-to-date with the benchmark, despite both having been generated correctly from the specification.</p>
<p>A frankenbuild is an inconsistent build state where an output β that was generated based on an intermediate output α is used together with a different version α’ of α due to cache substitution. This violates the necessary condition for the build to be correct, as the output β is not up-to-date with respect to its concrete input α’. The situation can happen in several ways, but only under some circumstances.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A build output α needs some variability that escapes the vigilance of the build system.</li>
<li>There also needs to be some other build output β that depends on α and exposes some of its variability.</li>
<li>Then the cache needs to store under the same cache key all the versions of β, generated from any variation of α.</li>
<li>And finally α’, a variation of α, needs to be generated and used wrongly in conjunction with the original β.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../images/frankenbuild_context.png" class="image-large center" /></p>
<p>This last point needs clarification as it covers a range of situations. A build system that gets a cache miss for α will regenerate a new α’. But two builds running in parallel can race to fill the cache, and each get only one of their two outputs stored, taking α’ from one and β from the other. Situations involving several caches also hide traps, as the two caches may have been populated separately.</p>
<p>Frankenbuilds are real threats to build theoretical correctness, but chiefly they could end up in long hair-pulling sessions where before finding that the two involved inputs are incompatible. As would be the case when you debug an executable with similar but incompatible debug symbols. And the infrequency of these events makes them even more ominous, because these are not part of the mental model of the users facing the issue. Fortunately, there are many ways in which they can be eradicated, or mitigated.</p>
<h2 id="cache-keys-are-the-key">Cache keys are the key</h2>
<p>One way to look at this issue is that there is confusion on the validity of output <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>. Being generated from the successive tasks <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is not sufficient to make it a correct build output for any output of task <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. A provenance relation needs to be respected to ensure the consistency of the full build. The confusion arises when cache keys do not encode this provenance. This is the case with build systems like Buck and Nix who computes cache keys based on the transitive closure of build instructions, and not the bits of intermediate results. This shows one weakness of these indexing schemes.</p>
<p>We call such a keying scheme “intensional”, as the keys define what the content should be. For example, the content under key <code>B(A(src))</code> is the result of applying task <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> on the output of task <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, itself called with the said initial <code>src</code> sources.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<pre><code>cache[&quot;B(A(src))&quot;] = β      # but also β&#39;
cache[&quot;A(src)&quot;] = α</code></pre>
</div>
<p>When cache keys for β include a digest of the actual α output, it becomes impossible to retrieve the β based on a differing α’. We call this keying mechanism “extensional”, as it computes computes a digest of the content of all the inputs of a task, and also of the definition of the task. The cache keys record more closely what objects are, and less the process that builds them.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<pre><code>cache[&quot;B(α)&quot;]   = β
cache[&quot;B(α&#39;)&quot;]  = β&#39;
cache[&quot;A(src)&quot;] = α</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is in essence the reasoning described by the authors of CloudBuild: “To avoid this issue, BuildCloud­includes the input’s content bag identity when computing a target’s CacheKey.” Faced with the issue, they augmented their cache keys with digests of concrete inputs, effectively switching to another class of build systems.</p>
<p>This new keying mechanism takes into accounts the exact inputs used during the build comes with strong implications. The value of α must be know to be able to compute the key to lookup β. This forces to serialize the queries to the cache along a dependency path and thus forces a bottom-up realisation of the build tree (i.e. a top-down realisation on the production tree presented here).</p>
<p>This impact is mitigated during incremental builds because digests can be cached locally. In that case an incremental build requires only an incremental set of queries to the cache. And yet, some companies reported that these constant back and forth from the builder to the server where a bottleneck for large builds. They had to focus on cache and network speed, and had to use tricks like a special cache api that returns the digest of α without returning the full content, or dedicated build farm APIs that handle the full build graph to resolve the keys close to the cache server, reducing round-trips <span class="citation" data-cites="BuildGraph">[@BuildGraph]</span>.</p>
<h2 id="intensional-advantages-intentional-advantages">Intensional advantages, intentional advantages</h2>
<p>As we have seen, extensional keying effectively prevents frankenbuilds, but comes with some constraints. Conversely, one may say that frankenbuilds arise due to the use of intensional keying schemes. And yet, Buck and Nix do rely on this flawed scheme, and there seems to be no traction in these projects to change in the foreseeable future. Let’s see why these projects use this keying scheme, and how they cope with its limitations. We will focus on Nix for it is the project we know best, but we can surmise that Buck follows approximately the same logic.</p>
<p>The reason why Nix uses intensional caches is that they allow to query for the presence of the final result directly, as the query can be constructed solely from the sources without any intermediate output. When a nix user wants to install a package, they are mostly interested in that package and the ones it depends upon at <em>run time</em>. They do not want to download the compiler that was used to compile it, nor the bootstrap compiler that was used to compile the compiler, and which are both <em>build time</em> dependencies of their packages.</p>
<p>Such incomplete builds where only a subset of the outputs are materialized are called shallow builds. They are not restricted to package managers like Nix. Materializing the whole set of intermediate outputs in a large codebase is often unnecessary and can waste a lot of local storage. When a developer edits a single file, they only need the intermediate products along the build branch that includes their file to reconstruct the final output.</p>
<p>Intensional keying make it faster to perform shallow builds as the final result can be queried immediately. On cache miss, it’s dependencies can be queried just as easily, until all the cached elements are found. The build can the proceed to materialize the missing outputs. This contrasts with key schemes, where the full closure of dependencies must be fetched (or at least their digest) in order to query the cache for the final binary.</p>
<p>As for frankenbuilds, they turn out to be theoretically possible, but not encountered in practice. There is only a single official cache for nix packages (i.e. nix build outputs). And only one build infrastructure is trusted to populate it. There is therefore no race to fill cache buckets. As for cache eviction, no package has ever been evicted (yet) from the central package cache of nix packages. With these two aspects, the main cache of packages is always consistent.</p>
<p>There remains scenarios where a use could end-up with frankenbuilds, for example when they build locally several packages not yet in the official cache (<span class="math inline"><em>α</em>′</span>), and later download more packages (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>) from the cache. With the advent of multiple caches <span class="citation" data-cites="Cachix">[@Cachix]</span>, populated and evicted differently, the issue may see a revival of interest.</p>
<h2 id="provenance-and-the-build-paths">Provenance and the build paths</h2>
<p>A recent initiative in the Nix world, the “content addressed store”, may eradicate frankenbuilds definitively. The changes encompass and are motivated by way more than frankenbuilds, but let’s explore how they address this particular issue.</p>
<p>In the process of designing CloudBuild, Esfahani et al. came with the concept of “provenance” relation. It captures the idea that a build can only be known to be correct if all the outputs are known to have been built from the other outputs that are materialized in the same build.</p>
<p>Instead of storing the provenance information in the cache keys, an alternative is to adjoin it to the cache values.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<pre><code>cache[&quot;B(A(src))&quot;] = (β&#39;, from B(α&#39;))
cache[&quot;A(src)&quot;] = (α, from A(src))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That way, downloaded entries can be checked for consistency with respect to the provenance relation. But it also means that the cache is less useful, as it may contain contradictory results. in this situation, a solution may be to store sets of cache entries under the same key.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<pre><code>cache[&quot;B(A(src))&quot;] = { (β, from B(α), (β&#39;, from B(α&#39;)) }
cache[&quot;A(src)&quot;] = { (α, from A(src)) }</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This solution is undesirable in practice, because all the entries must be downloaded and tested in sequence, and may still end up on a cache miss if none matches.</p>
<p>The content addressed store initiative works around this issue, by maintaining a content addressed cache of build outputs.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<pre><code>cache[&quot;B(A(src))&quot;] = β&#39;
cache[&quot;A(src)&quot;] = α

cache[&quot;α&quot;]  = (α,  from A(src))
cache[&quot;α&#39;&quot;] = (α&#39;, from A(src))
cache[&quot;β&quot;]  = (β,  from B(α))
cache[&quot;β&#39;&quot;] = (β&#39;, from B(α&#39;))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In this fashion, the provenance chain can be reconstructed from the cache, if all the entries are still present. Clients of the cache can thus avoid materializing frankenbuilds. This convoluted scheme is still vulnerable to other issues and inefficiencies, but not frankenbuilds.</p>
<h2 id="the-ultimate-razor">The ultimate razor</h2>
<p>Looking back at the necessary conditions for frankenbuilds to happen, we have seen that we can work around condition 4. by being careful not to let frankenbuilds happen in the cache, with centralised caches and restricted population strategies, or by tagging cache entries with provenance information. Condition 3. can be falsified by switching to another keying scheme, but that is a huge change in the build system design. Conditions 2. and 1. are also worth investigating.</p>
<p>Condition 2 states that there must be a second output that depends on the first, variable one, and that it must expose its variability. As build systems with no inter dependant tasks are way more limited than their inter dependant counterparts, it is not of great use. And while it is worth noting that there exists build system tasks that do not expose the variability in their dependencies, it is impossible to assert that for all the tasks of a general purpose build system.</p>
<p>Finally, condition 1 is quite interesting. It states that frankenbuilds cannot happen with tasks that exhibit no variability. While that property can again not be enforced nor verified for the tasks of a general purpose build system, hunting down variability reduces the chances of materializing frankenbuilds, and further reduces the chances of ever incurring its negative effects.</p>
<p>The property of a task with no variability s called reproducibility. A task is perfectly reproducible when all it’s executions yield the same output, bit for bit. Reproducibility cannot be guaranteed, but it can be tested, and examples of identical results in various conditions, as well as the absence of any variation in the long run can give some confidence that the task is indeed reproducible.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frankenbuild_reproducible.png" class="image-medium center" /></p>
<p>Reproducibility is the holy grail of build systems. It makes caching perfectly efficient, gives perfect confidence in binary outputs, and trivially reduces provenance tracking. It’s no wonder that binary package repositories strive to eradicate nondeterminism in their tasks. Linux distributions even started the reproducible build initiative <span class="citation" data-cites="RBI">[@RBI]</span> to share experience and good practice in reproducible package builds.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>From the niche frankenbuild issue, we have explored a large variety of build systems designs, and in particular nontrivial cache keying schemes. We have seen the conditions to create a monstrous frankenbuild, and various solutions to work around them when one really wants to live in the world of intensional keying schemes. Finally, we had a quick look at reproducibility, the ever escaping ideal in the world of build systems. Reproducibility, to paraphrase Terry Pratchett, didn’t just kill the frankenbuild, it threw it in the river with lead weights tied to its feet.</p>

    <title>How to Digest Nix Hashes ?</title>
    <link>https://blog.layus.be/posts/2020-09-01-nix-hashes.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<article>
    <p>They say there are two hard things in computing: cache invalidation and naming things. Alas, build systems fight against these two at the same time. Because caching build results is a central feature of most build systems, they are immediately concerned by cache invalidation issues. For naming things, it is less obvious. I used to understand the naming problem as related to concepts and source code variables. Finding the right name for a class, a function or a variable can be a real headache.</p>
<p>But it can also be difficult to generate a meaningful name for values manipulated by programs. Nix and a range of build systems have to forge unique and deterministic names for intermediate build results. These names are used as cache keys. In the case of Nix, the names are first class citizens as they are visible in the public store, in the form of store paths.</p>
<p>Did you ever wonder what’s in your Nix hashes? Or how they are computed? Two different projects led me to further investigate these questions. Implementing <a href="https://github.com/haskell-Nix">HNix</a> store and shepherding the “Content addressed paths” <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/62">RFC #62</a>. In both cases, understanding how path names (and the other hashes) are generated took some time. Here is what I learned.</p>
<h2 id="store-path-hashes">Store path hashes</h2>
<p>The most visible digests in Nix appears in store path names. Lets take for example a pinned version of <code>hello</code>.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode nix"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="bu">let</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">nixpkgs</span> = import (builtins.fetchTarball {</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="ex">url</span> = <span class="st">&quot;https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/archive/c59ea8b8a0e7f927e7291c14ea6cd1bd3a16ff38.tar.gz&quot;</span><span class="kw">;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="ex">sha256</span> = <span class="st">&quot;1ak7jqx94fjhc68xh1lh35kh3w3ndbadprrb762qgvcfb8351x8v&quot;</span><span class="kw">;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>  }) {};</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">in</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">nixpkgs.hello</span> # =<span class="op">&gt;</span> /nix/store/ab1pfk338f6gzpglsirxhvji4g9w558i-hello-2.10</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Nix composes the hash part of the path by compressing to 32 base32 characters (160 bits or 20 bytes) a sha256 digest. Base32 encoding is unique to Nix. It uses digits and lower-case letters (except <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/no-hashes-starting-with-e-t-o-or-u-in-nix-store/4906/1">EOUT</a>) for a total of 32 characters valid in a file name. The result is more dense than base16 while avoiding the strange characters of base64 (<code>+</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>=</code>) amongst which <code>/</code> would create a lot of trouble in file names.</p>
<p>For example <code>/nix/store/ab1pfk338f6gzpglsirxhvji4g9w558i-hello-2.10</code> contains <code><b>ab1pfk338f6g</b>zpglsirxhvji4g9w558i</code> which is the compression on 20 bytes of <code>0fqqilza6ifk0arlay18<b>ab1pfk338f6g</b>zrpcb56pnaw245h8gv9r</code>. Basically folding excess bits with xor. Notice how some characters are shared, as the input is so small that some of them are passed as-is.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<pre><code>  ab1pfk338f6gzrpcb56pnaw245h8gv9r
^             0fqqilza6ifk0arlay18
  --------------------------------
= ab1pfk338f6gzpglsirxhvji4g9w558i</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The full (uncompressed) digest comes from hashing the string <code>output:out:sha256:5d4447675168bb44442f0d225ab8b50b7a67544f0ba2104dbf74926ff4df1d1e:/nix/store:hello-2.10</code>. This string is a fingerprint of the important parts of that derivation. If any part changes, the hash will be different, and it will produce a different output path.</p>
<p>We can see four parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>output:out</code> is the type of the fingerprint. Here we fingerprint something used for an output path. The output named <code>out</code> in this case. Nix uses various types, and each expects different things in the remainder of the string.</li>
<li><code>sha256:5d4447675168bb44442f0d225ab8b50b7a67544f0ba2104dbf74926ff4df1d1e</code> is the hash of the derivation building hello. As a hash it encompasses many things, and we will explore that further below.</li>
<li><code>/nix/store</code> is the store prefix.</li>
<li><code>hello-2.10</code> is the name of the derivation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hashing the derivation is a tricky part. Nix store a lot of information about derivations. To read it, we can use <code>nix show-derivation</code> on our <code>hello</code> package.</p>

<p>However, hashing this derive string directly does not yield the expected hash found above. (Do you recall the <code>sha256:5d4447675168bb44442f0d225ab8b50b7a67544f0ba2104dbf74926ff4df1d1e</code> ?)</p>

<p>To understand where this hash comes from, it helps to understand other types of store objects. Let’s make a small detour to simpler paths.</p>
<h2 id="text-files">Text files</h2>
<p>Raw text files whose content is know by Nix without running any builder are named by a comparatively simpler scheme. Their name is a digest over both the content and the name of the path.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<pre><code>$ nix-instantiate --eval --expr &#39;builtins.toFile &quot;file-name&quot; &quot;some content&quot;&#39;

</div>
<p>The text format is also used by .drv files. But .drv files can depend on other .drv files. All the dependencies appear between the <code>text:</code> and <code>:sha256</code> part of the path description.</p>

We have already seen ‘text’ right now and ‘output’ before. The third type is ‘source’, for some well-behaved, content addressed paths.</p>
<h2 id="hashing-modulo">Hashing modulo</h2>
<p>Back to our initial <code>pkgs.hello</code> store path. We were stuck at understanding the hash used there.</p>

</div>
<p>Ideally, this would be the hash of the ‘derive’ string from the .drv. This is not the case because it would be impossible and undesirable. The impossibility comes from the fact that the output paths of a derivation are part of its ‘derive’ string. The loop needs to be broken somewhere. That is why the output paths are replaced with empty strings before hashing the ‘derive’ string used in output paths.</p>
<p>The other aspect comes from fixed-output paths. While the recipe to build them may vary (and hence their derive string) we would like to avoid propagating such changes to other derivations outputs. As fixed-output derivations can happen anywhere in the dependency tree, the process of replacing the hash of fixed-output derivations needs to be recursive. This is performed by <code>hashDerivationModulo()</code> whose name hints that the hashing is made modulo the equivalence of recipes for the same fixed-output paths.</p>
<p>It means that instead of the former <code>nix show-derivation</code> result, hashDerivationModulo ends up hashing a modified derive string.</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>As we have seen, hashing in Nix is based on several concepts.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Description strings</dt>
<dd>starting with a type, and separated with colons. Highly recognisable. They describe uniquely a ressource. In practice, we never encounter them, as they are always hashed with sha256.
</dd>
<dt>Hash compression</dt>
<dd>The hash appearing in path names is a folded version of full digests. Nix compresses the hash to 32 base32 characters.
</dd>
<dt>Maksing</dt>
<dd><em>Derive</em> strings contain the output paths of the derivation. As these output paths are generated based on a digest of the derivation itself, we have to break the loop. Masking is the process of removing output paths from a <em>derive</em> string before computing it’s hash.
</dd>
<dt>Hashing modulo [other derivations]</dt>
<dd>Digests of derivations form a tree. Any change to a dependency’s <em>derive</em> string will propagate to all the dependant .drv paths and output paths. But it makes little sense to propagate changes in the recipe (the <em>derive</em> string) of a fixed output path. By definition, they will produce the same output regardless of their recipe. Nix computes output paths hashes on a tree of digests where fixed-output <em>derive</em> strings are replaced by the fixed-output hash.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="practical-issues">Practical issues</h2>
<p>So much for technical considerations. What is this useful for? The way hashes are computed constrains how they can be computed and generated.</p>
<p>In an HNix <a href="https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix-store/pull/59#discussion_r429582370-permalink">discussion</a>, I discovered that the Nix daemon has two API calls to build derivations.</p>
<p><code>opBuildPaths</code> is the most obvious one. It takes a list of pre-uploaded .drv files and triggers the build. Because a .drv depends on other .drv files, the full closure needs to be uploaded to the store upfront. In our example, that closure represents 280 .drv files to upload before starting the build. And <code>hello</code> is a relatively small package. This can slow down build times in distributed remote building situation where the builder responsible for a package may not be the one that built its dependencies. The machine will have to download all the .drv files when all it really needs is the <code>hello</code> .drv file and the build inputs paths.</p>
<p>That is why <code>opBuildDerivation</code> was implemented. It takes all the information from a derivation and builds it. The input paths need to be uploaded beforehand, but nothing more. This nice feature come with a downside. As we have seen, the ouptut path of a derivation is computed with hashDerivationModulo, which requires the full closure of derivations to substitute the hashe of fixed-output ones. Without the closure, it is impossible for the builder to check the validity of an output path. That is why this API call is a privileged operation.</p>
<p>Allowing unprivileged builds without the .drv closure is not an easy feature. As Eelco Dolstra states in the <a href="1511aa9f488ba0762c2da0bf8ab61b5fde47305d">commit introducing <code>opBuildDerivation</code></a>, it would require changing the hashing scheme. And finding the right balance is complicated. Using a hash “without modulo” means that changing <em>how</em> we build fixed-output derivations will propagate to all the package. Not hashing inputs makes it possible to obtain the same output path name for all the derivations that change only in their inputs. For example, updating gcc would not change our <code>hello</code> output path. You could get different things under the same name. Not an option.</p>
<p>That sentence from Eelco Dolstra feels a bit like Fermat’s last theorem. While it seems to imply that there exists other hashing schemes, nothing is said about these schemes. Years later (the commit dates from 2015), the solution comes from a different angle. The long discussed, argued (and ultimately postponed) feature of a content-addressed store could bring builds without the .drv closure. Much like the proof of Fermat’s last theorem, the implementation of the content-addressed store comes long after the problem is sketched but, were it used only to solve that specific problem, would also feels like bringing an elephant to kill the mouse.</p>
<h3 id="content-addressed-paths">Content-addressed paths</h3>
<p>In the content-addressed store, output path names are not derived from their .drv, but from their content. Orthogonal changes to .drv files are not reflected in the name, and do not propagate. The name changes only if the content changes. The major downside is that output path names cannot be known before their content is made available. That’s why we need two names. On for the output path we want to build, and one for the actual content-addressed result.</p>
<p>In such a setup, there is no need anymore for <code>hashDerivationModulo</code>. I tend to see <code>hashDerivationModulo</code> as a hack, a workaround to limit useless rebuilds as much as possible without having to implement the content-addressed store in its full complexity. That hack served us well over the years, and content-addressed stores are not yet implemented.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>There is already a lot in this article, but we did not cover everything. There are several ways to upload a content-addressed path to the store, and content-addressed paths can also depend on other content-addressed paths. There are other funny corner cases here and there. But overall, this sketches the idea behind Nix store paths generation, and gives an idea of how derivations and store paths interact.</p>
<p>I had to leave aside the detailed explanation of content-addressed stores, but this is perhaps not for long…</p>
<p>This blog is still lacking a proper way to leave comments, but I would be more than happy to receive remarks, comments, advices and praises by email, or by any other channel if you are willing to wait more.</p>

    <title>Nix overlays: the fixpoint and the (over)layer cake</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<article>
    <h1 id="the-fixpoint-and-the-overlayer-cake">The fixpoint and the (over)layer cake</h1>
<p>I am a big fan of the overlay system that Nix uses to allow modular tweaks to the otherwise monolithic and centralized nixpkgs. But the rules about their two arguments are crazy. Why should packages come from <code>self</code> and other things from <code>super</code>. Is it really important ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I got started digging into these overlays and their mechanics, the post became a bit too involved. I decided to split it in two parts. This first part describes how overlays work, and why they have been implemented in that fashion. The <a href="/posts/nix-super-overlays">next</a> will dig deeper into the rules for a good use of <code>self</code> and <code>super</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The overlay system is best described by its architect, Nicolas B. Pierron (@<a href="https://github.com/nbp">nbp</a>) in his NixCon 2017 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W85mF1zWA2o">talk</a>. For those who, like me, prefer text resources for learning, I should also mention the <a href="https://nbp.github.io/slides/NixCon/2017.NixpkgsOverlays/">slides</a> of the presentation, as well as the relevant entries in the <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#chap-overlays">nixpkgs manual</a> and the <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays">nixos wiki</a>.</p>
<h2 id="overlays-primer">Overlays primer</h2>
<p>Nixpkgs is a large set of nix packages maintained by the community. It can be seen as a mapping between package names and their definition.</p>
<p>For representation purposes, we will make the assumption that a package (a <em>derivation</em> in nix parlance) is the result of calling a <em>deriving</em> (i.e. building) function with <em>i)</em> a version number and <em>ii)</em> other derivations as dependencies.</p>
<p>Here is a simplified view of <code>nixpkgs</code> as can be obtained with a trivial call like <code>nix import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/2020-06-12-nix-overlays/nixpkgs.png" class="image-very-large" alt="" /><figcaption>The vanilla nixpkgs package set</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We see that packages dependencies form a directed acyclic graph, a.k.a a <em>DAG</em>. Such graphs can be seen as simple trees for the majority of purposes. In such a graph, circular dependencies are impossible. While technically the Nix language allows to define such loops, they lead to <code>error: infinite recursion encountered</code> during evaluation. Properly behaved package sets do not do that, and so neither does nixpkgs.</p>
<p>Leaf packages are not used by any other packages. This is the case for <code>firefox</code> in our contrived example. A few bootstrap packages do not depend on any other packages. In our example, it is <code>stdenv</code>.</p>
<p>Nixpkgs is a huge monolith of code containing <a href="https://repology.org/repository/nix_unstable">over 60k packages</a>. In 2016, it even appeared in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914231036/https://octoverse.github.com/">2016 edition of Github’s “State of the Octoverse”</a> report as the #6 repo in terms of code reviewers. While busy, the repository cannot accept every custom package of nixpkgs users. Nor can it accept private, licensed or in development packages. Enter “overlays”. The feature allows to make additions and modifications to the locally available nixpkgs package set.</p>
<p>To add a new package or override an existing package, overlays merge the new definitions inside the main package set. This is an attribute set <em>update</em> operation, as defined by the corresponding nix <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#table-operators">“<code>//</code>” operator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-naive-overlay">A naive overlay</h2>
<p>Assuming you want a firefox built without pulseaudio, and prefer to use v71 instead of v70.1 provided in nixpkgs. You would have to define a new firefox derivation, and merge it into nixpkgs like this:</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode nix"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="bu">let</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">nixpkgs</span> = import <span class="op">&lt;</span>nixpkgs<span class="op">&gt;</span> {};</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">custom</span> = {</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="ex">firefox</span> = derive(<span class="st">&quot;71&quot;</span>, nixpkgs.zlib, nixpkgs.gcc, nixpkgs.stdenv)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>  }</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">in</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">nixpkgs</span> // custom</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This gets you an updated package set where the original definition of firefox is no more visible. The attribute <code>firefox</code> references your new, custom version.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/2020-06-12-nix-overlays/nixpkgs+ff.png" class="image-very-large" alt="" /><figcaption>An overlay for firefox</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the resulting package set, the attribute <code>firefox</code> will reference your new package. Such overlays can also be used to add new packages, by picking an attribute name that is not yet in use. For a custom version of firefox, it would also make sense to give it a unique name, like <code>firefox-custom</code>.</p>
<p>This way of overlaying packages shows its limits when you want to modify an internal package in the dependency tree. Assuming that, for some reason, you would prefer your system to be compiled with gcc v8.1.1 instead of the provided v7.2.0. Working in the same way as above, you would obtain a package set where the attribute <code>gcc</code> references your new package, but all of the other packages are still being compiled with the old gcc. This is highlighted by the red references edges in our representation of package sets.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/2020-06-12-nix-overlays/nixpkgs+zlib.png" class="image-very-large" alt="" /><figcaption>The gcc overlay is not picked up by existing packages</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Working only with attribute sets update (<code>//</code>), there is no way to propagate changes to an existing package set. To propagate overlays to existing packages, we need support from nixpkgs itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-nixpkgs-fixpoint">The nixpkgs fixpoint</h2>
<p>To support overlays, <span class="citation" data-cites="nbp">@nbp</span> modified nixpkgs in such a way that it does not depend on itself directly, but on some other theoretical package set that should contain roughly the sames packages as itself. Technically, nixpkgs is designed as a function that takes as input all the dependencies used by nixpkgs. At this point, I think a picture is worth a thousand linguistic wandering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/2020-06-12-nix-overlays/nixpkgs_layers.png" class="image-very-large" alt="" /><figcaption>Nixpkgs uses inputs from a elsewhere</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, the only package set that could possibly provide all of the required dependencies is nixpkgs itself. <em>No problem!</em> Let’s just pass it as the input set to nixpkgs.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/2020-06-12-nix-overlays/nixpkgs_layers2.png" class="image-very-large" alt="" /><figcaption>Nixpkgs, built on top of nixpkgs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You probably already heard it, but nixpkgs is implemented as a fixpoint. The term may be frightening at first glance, but the idea is just to feed the nixpkgs function to itself, forever, so that there are no more dangling dependencies in nixpkgs. In terms of code, it amounts to an infinitely recursive definition.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode nix"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="bu">let</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">nixpkgs_fun</span> = self: {</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="ex">firefox</span> = derive(<span class="st">&quot;70.1&quot;</span>, self.pulseaudio, self.zlib, ...)</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="ex">pulseaudio</span> = ...</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="ex">...</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>  };</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">nixpkgs</span> = nixpkgs_fun nixpkgs</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">in</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">nixpkgs</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Fear not, this recursion is not infinite in practice, because the Nix language is lazy. It is even quite efficient, because the definition of <code>nixpkgs</code> is shared. Which means that instead of copying the same nixpkgs function over and over, the pacakge set is made to reuse itself, the same actual value, computed lazily.</p>
<h2 id="nixpkgs-overlays">Nixpkgs overlays</h2>
<p>In nixpkgs overlays are added before feeding nixpkgs into itself. When the recursion is applied, nixpkgs uses the full stack of overlays to look for dependencies. This means that nixpkgs will catch the updated packages. I our former example with gcc, it means that all the packages depending on gcc will find the updated version, and build with it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/2020-06-12-nix-overlays/nixpkgs_layers_plus.png" class="image-very-large" alt="" /><figcaption>The vanilla nixpkgs package set</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually building this package set will take some time, as none of the newly defined packages exist in the binary cache. You will be rebuilding your whole package set from scratch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of indirect references to other packages, so as to ply nicely with the nixpkgs fixpoint is done through the <code>self</code> argument of an overlay. That is, the first argument to the overlay function, as it is quite easy (and frequent) to mistype the arguments order. For the record, <code>self: super:</code> is the only right version.</p>
<h2 id="the-super-nixpkgs">The <code>super</code> nixpkgs</h2>
<p>But what is this <code>super</code> argument useful for then ? In case you want to make some modifications to an existing package. Like a patch for example. Let’s assume that you need a specific patch for your firefox. You could define an overlay like this.</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode nix"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="co"># In real life scenarios,</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="co"># you would probably patch firefox-unwrapped instead</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">self</span>: super:</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">firefox</span> = super.firefox.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: {</span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="ex">patches</span> = (oldAttrs.patches or []) <span class="ex">++</span> [ ./fixit.patch ]<span class="kw">;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="kw">}</span>;</span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using <code>self</code> here would make no sense, because it will end up being the very firefox you are trying to define. Nix will detect this loop, and raise the painful <code>error: infinite recursion encountered</code> described above.</p>
<p>It makes little sense to use <code>self.fooBar</code> in the definition of <code>foobar</code> itself. After all, the names have been chosen for their similarity with inheritance models. <code>self</code> (sometimes called <code>this</code>) is the final object, while <code>super</code> is a reference to the previous class in the inheritance hierarchy.</p>
<p>How much sense would this code make ?</p>
<div class="scroll-wrapper">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">class</span> Animal {</span>

<p>Now, you have all the keys to understand the concise diagram for overlays found on the nixos wiki. If you squint hard enough, you can even see the class diagram in there :-).</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="rules-rules-rules">Rules, rules, rules</h2>
<p>Now, just like three years ago, some corner cases make it hard to know when to use <code>super</code> and when to use <code>self</code>. There are some good examples in the NixCon presentation, but they do not make everything clear.</p>
<p>For packages, the rule is simple. Use <code>self</code>, except when you want to override some pre-existing recipe. In that case use <code>super</code>. The rule conforms to the inheritance model for classes.</p>
<p>For functions, and other values, it seems that <code>super</code> is the way to go. And it bugs me terribly since I defined a helper overlay for helper functions. As overlays have a precise order, using <code>super</code> may not find the function if your overlay happens to be included before the lib overlay…</p>
<p>After some investigations, it turns out the reason behind using <code>self</code> only for packages is <em>grafting</em>. And that concept, as well as its impact on the design of overlays, will be explored in the next post.</p>
